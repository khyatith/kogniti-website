			<h1>To take challenges head-on.</h1> 

			<p>56% of the youth feel that the future of the world is doomed. This is because somewhere in the education system, they are not being taught how to deal with challenges.

			In Kogniti, we provided kids with unique challenges everyday to build their habit!</p>
