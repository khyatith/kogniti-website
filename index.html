			<h1>To take challenges head-on.</h1> 

			<p>56% of the youth feel that the future of the world is doomed. This is because somewhere in the education system, they are not being taught how to deal with challenges.
			<br><br>
			In Kogniti, we provided kids with unique challenges everyday to build their habit!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box" style="background-color:#AF7AC5;">

			<h1>First-principles thinking</h1> 

			<p>Kids will learn how to remove all the assumptions and learn to find out facts. <br>
				<br>

			This is called thinking from first-principles.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="box" style="background-color:#F1948A;">

			<h1>Self-efficacy.</h1> 

			<p>Self-efficacy is the belief that we ourselves can affect positive changes in our lives.
			<br><br>
			Self-efficacy is the biggest skill to be built in the future generation.</p>

		<h1>Approach</h1>

		<div class="Approach_p">
			<p><br>
			The world as we know it is constantly evolving. The problems that were present 100 years ago are not there anymore. Instead, we have bigger problems to solve. A lot of these problems are unknown to us.We can only hope to provide the necessary skills to our kids to enable them to solve for the unknown. 
			<br><br>	
			But how do we do that? How do we build the skills of the future in kids today?
			<br><br>
			Well, we wouldnâ€™t exactly know what skills kids would need in the future but we know for sure that in any scenario in the future, kids would definitely need to be able to -
			<br>
			
				<li>Take challenges head-on</li>
				<li>Have the belief that they themselves can affect positive change in their own life and,</li>
				<li>Collaborate with others around them to solve complex problems.</li>
			<br>
			What do we need to build these skills? Practice.
			<br><br>
			Kids need to have a safe space to get exposed to constant challenges where they can build the belief in their unique abilities and collaborate with other kids to solve the challenges. And they need to do it again and again and then some more.
			<br><br>
			This is why Kogniti is here.
			<br><br>
			We create complex, unique experiences and provide a safe environment for kids to build the skills to solve the problems of tomorrow.
			<br><br>
			Once a week kids log in to our zoom sessions, compete in teams to solve unique challenges post which our trainers help kids to self-reflect on their actions. 
			<br><br>
			Kogniti is where kids are not scared to take challenges head-on. 
			<br>
			<b>Kogniti is where kids become problem solvers.</b></p>
